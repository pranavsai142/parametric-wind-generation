How to generate parametric wind and rain

0. Make sure you have pipenv installed. https://pypi.org/project/pipenv/
Enter the pipenv environment by typing
"pipenv shell" inside the parametric-wind-generation folder
You should see this after running pipenv shell. The enclosed value at the beginning shows you are in of a pipenv shell.
IMPORTANT: After done working in a shell, exit the shell by typing "exit" and enter.

Run pipenv install to download all needed dependencies. 
If pipenv is not working, you can manaully download the dependencies. They are listed in the Pipfile.



1. Run metget to get track file. Change the domain variable to reflect
year, basin, storm number, storm name. This information is found at the
top of an NHC advisory. The start and end dates are not always followed if there is no data, adjust accordingly.

First run this: ". ./MetGetEnv.sh"

Then this:
metget build --domain nhc-2024-al-14-013 0.1 -100.0 5.0 -60.0 47.0 --start '2024-10-06 00:00' --end '2024-10-16 00:00' --timestep 3600 --strict --compression --format raw --output milton_track_13




2. Metget generates 3 different files. Copy the name of the file that ends in  ".trk"
Run the following command to generate parametric products.

"python generator.py --file NAME_OF_FILE.trk"


3. Run the following command to generate parametric wind. *Dependent on step 2*
The windgfdl program reads two files, track.richamp and Wind_Inp.txt generated by step 2.

"./windgfdl"

4. Run conversion script to convert owi .wnd type file to netcdf

"python owi2wind.py richamp.wnd Wind_Inp.txt -o storm_parametric_wind"
